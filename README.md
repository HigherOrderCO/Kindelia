Kindelia: an efficient, secure cryptocomputer
=============================================

Decentralized computers, such as Ethereum and Cardano, raise the concept of
cryptocurrencies to a new level, and promise to be the foundation of a
completely digitized global economy. To make this viable, however, it is
necessary to reach a threshold of security and efficiency that none of these
networks has achieved yet.

By leveraging a new functional virtual machine, the HVM, we're able to massively
cut the costs of layer-1 transactions, for the same usage level. This, in turn,
allows formally verified programs to run directly on the blockchain, making
contracts inherently secure. Finally, there is no premine, because there are no
tokens to begin with, making the it truly fair. Kindelia isn't a cryptocurrency:
it is just an efficient and secure cryptocomputer.

Introduction
============

_TODO_

### Efficiency

Its virtual machine, the HVM, can do up to _TODO_ more arithmetic operations per
second, and, notably, _TODO_ more pattern-matches per second. Moreover, Kindelia
transactions are up to _TODO_ smaller than Ethereum. These numbers mean that, at
baseline, Kindelia transactions should be 2 orders of magnitude cheaper than
Ethereum's, at the same usage level. That doesn't come from a layer-2 solution,
nor zero-knowledge proofs. This is exclusively due to sheer layer-1 efficiency,
which, even though not sufficient to achieve long-term scalability, does matter;
after all, layer-2 transactions must still use layer-1, and zero-knowledge
proofs add overwhelming complexity to the system.
