Kindelia
========

A peer-to-peer functional computer capable of hosting decentralized apps that stay up forever. Essentially, it is a complete redesign of Ethereum's idea, built upon type theoretic foundations. Main differences include:

- There is no native coin. It is not a cryptocurrency, it is a cryptocomputer.

- The [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) is replaced by the [HVM](https://github.com/kindelia/hvm), a blazingly fast functional runtime.

- It can run formally verified programs from languages like [Idris](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2) and [Kind](https://github.com/kindelia/kind) natively.

- Zero-cost SSTOREs, allowing dynamic games and virtual worlds to run on layer 1.

- Truly decentralized, not just in code. **Political** and **economical** decentralization were addressed.

- It is so minimalist and elegant you could call it a massively multiplayer Î»-calculus REPL.
