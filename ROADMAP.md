ROADMAP
=======

Kindelia's development will follow a 4-phases roadmap.

Prelude: client development
---------------------------

### Jan 2022 - Jul 2022

Kindelia's paper and client prototype will be developed, including:

- A Proof-of-Work network, for consensus.

- A 128-bit version of the High-Order Virtual Machine (HVM), for computation.

- Reversible HVM heap snapshots, for statefulness.

Neon: testnet release
---------------------

### Jul 2022 - Jan 2023

- Kindelia's network and client prototype will be heavily tested.

- Kindelia Foundation's Initial Name Offering (INO) will take place on Ethereum's network.

- Mainnet parameters will be tested, defined and adjusted.

Genesis: mainnet release
------------------------

### Jan 2023 - Jan 2024

- Kindelia's Genesis Block (block #0) will be mined. On it:

    - Primitive utilies like tuples will be deployed.

    - Kindelia's empty namespace will be registered by the Kindelia Foundation.

    - The namespaces purchased on the INO will be granted to its owners.

    - Kindelia Genesis Token (KGT) will be deployed.

        KGT will work exactly like Bitcoin (BTC), including halvings and no premine.

- Users will deploy and use the first apps of the network.

- The Kindelia Foundation will mine and distribute tokens via grants and airdrops.

- Downtimes, patches and parameter changes are expected to occur.

Evangelion: mainnet history
---------------------------

### Jan 2024 - Heat Death of the Universe

- The network will be considered stable and no more patches should be expected.

- Kindelia will be host a constellation of hack-proof apps with minimal fees and infinite uptime.

- The Kindelia Foundation will no longer maintain the network. It will focus on:

  - Improving the HVM

  - Improving Kind-Lang

  - Researching layer 2 scalability solutions

  - Developing ecosystem applications

  - Giving community grants

- Community-driven forks to adjust parameters (like the mana limit) may still occur.
